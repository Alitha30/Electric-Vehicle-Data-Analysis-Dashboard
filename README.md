# Electric-Vehicle-Data-Analysis-Dashboard
 This project presents an interactive Electric Vehicle (EV) Data Analysis Dashboard designed to visualize and analyze trends in electric vehicle adoption,
charging infrastructure, and performance metrics. Built for data-driven decision-making, the dashboard provides insights useful for
policymakers, researchers, EV manufacturers, and the general public.
 Dashboard Features:
Interactive Visualizations: Dynamic charts and graphs for intuitive data exploration.

EV Adoption Trends: Analyze EV registrations by year, state, and vehicle make.

Battery and Range Stats: Compare battery capacity, vehicle range, and efficiency across models.

Charging Infrastructure: Explore charging station locations and types across regions.

Filters & Custom Views: Drill down by geography, year, vehicle type, and more.

 Technologies Used
Frontend:  Power BI (update based on your tech stack)

Backend: Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Data Visualization:  Matplotlib, Seaborn

Deployment: (Optional: Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, Docker, etc.)

 Dataset Description:
The dashboard utilizes public EV datasets which may include:

Vehicle Data: Make, model, range, battery capacity, registration date, vehicle class.

Geographical Info: State, city, zip code of registration or charger installation.

Charging Station Data: Location, connector types, power levels.
